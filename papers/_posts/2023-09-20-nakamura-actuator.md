# Abstract

At all levels in biology, form and function are closely interdependent. Mitochondria have particularly attracted attention since their altered morphology is often observed under pathophysiological conditions including heart failure and Alzheimer's disease. Despite the physiological significance, assessing the direct causal relationship between mitochondrial morphology and function has been out of reach, primarily due to limitations of the existing experimental technologies such as optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy in manipulating the morphology of this submicron length-scale entity deep inside living cells. By engineering an actin regulator, ActA, derived from Listeria monocytogenes, and coupling it with protein dimerization schemes, we first established molecular tools collectively termed ActuAtor that can trigger actin polymerization to exert constrictive forces at subcellular locations of choice in a rapidly inducible manner. The ActuAtor-mediated forces drove striking movement and/or deformation of target intracellular structures including mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and nucleus, as well as non-membrane-bound biomolecular condensates such as stress granules. We then implemented ActuAtor in functional assays of mitochondria, uncovering that the fragmented mitochondria are more susceptible to degradation, while none of the other essential functions tested, such as ATP synthesis, are morphology dependent. The modular and genetically-encoded features of ActuAtor should enable its application in de novo studies of the interplay between form and function at various intracellular and subcellular spaces.
