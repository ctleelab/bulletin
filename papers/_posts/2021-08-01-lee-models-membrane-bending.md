# Abstract

The budding of membranes and curvature generation is common to many forms of trafficking in cells. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, as a prototypical example of trafficking, has been studied in great detail using a variety of experimental systems and methods. Recently, advances in experimental methods have led to great strides in insights on the molecular mechanisms and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the protein machinery associated with membrane curvature generation. These advances have been ably supported by computational models, which have given us insights into the underlying mechanical principles of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. On the other hand, targeted experimental perturbation of membranes has lagged behind that of proteins in cells. In this area, modeling is especially critical to interpret experimental measurements in a mechanistic context. Here, we discuss the contributions made by these models to our understanding of endocytosis and identify opportunities to strengthen the connections between models and experiments.
