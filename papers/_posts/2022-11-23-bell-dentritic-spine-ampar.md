# Abstract

The modification of neural circuits depends on the strengthening and weakening of synaptic connections. Synaptic strength is often correlated to the density of the ionotropic, glutamatergic receptors, AMPARs, (Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors) at the postsynaptic density (PSD). While AMPAR density is known to change based on complex biological signalling cascades, the effect of geometric factors such as dendritic spine shape, size and curvature remain poorly understood. In this work, we developed a deterministic, spatiotemporal model to study the dynamics of AMPARs during long-term potentiation (LTP). This model includes a minimal set of biochemical events that represent the upstream signalling events, trafficking of AMPARs to and from the PSD, lateral diffusion in the plane of the spine membrane, and the presence of an extrasynaptic AMPAR pool. Using idealized and realistic spine geometries, we show that the dynamics and increase of bound AMPARs at the PSD depends on a combination of endo- and exocytosis, membrane diffusion, the availability of free AMPARs and intracellular signalling interactions. We also found non-monotonic relationships between spine volume and the change in AMPARs at the PSD, suggesting that spines restrict changes in AMPARs to optimize resources and prevent runaway potentiation. Key points Synaptic plasticity involves dynamic biochemical and physical remodelling of small protrusions called dendritic spines along the dendrites of neurons. Proper synaptic functionality within these spines requires changes in receptor number at the synapse, which has implications for downstream neural functions, such as learning and memory formation. In addition to being signalling subcompartments, spines also have unique morphological features that can play a role in regulating receptor dynamics on the synaptic surface. We have developed a spatiotemporal model that couples biochemical signalling and receptor trafficking modalities in idealized and realistic spine geometries to investigate the role of biochemical and biophysical factors in synaptic plasticity. Using this model, we highlight the importance of spine size and shape in regulating bound AMPA receptor dynamics that govern synaptic plasticity, and predict how spine shape might act to reset synaptic plasticity as a built-in resource optimization and regulation tool.
