Atsushi is a postdoc in the [aka MATSU Lab](https://sites.uw.edu/matsulab) at the University of Washington and co-advised by Chris.
He earned his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, where he conducted research in Mohammad Mofrad's group. 
His doctoral work focused on investigating the dynamic process of molecular transport through the nuclear pore complex using computational and theoretical approaches. 

Currently, he is developing numerical methods to estimate the mechanical state of cellular membranes captured in cryo-electron tomography images. 
This method integrates membrane mechanics principles with statistical inference techniques and will be applied to endocytosis data to analyze detailed force distributions during membrane budding. 
Outside the lab, Atsushi enjoys cooking and discovering various restaurants in the city.
