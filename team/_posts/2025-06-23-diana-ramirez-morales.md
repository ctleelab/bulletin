I am a Biotechnology Engineering student at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Querétaro. 
I have a strong interest in biology, neuroscience, and chemistry. 
I’ve previously participated in research on Alzheimer’s disease at Dr. William Mobley’s lab in the Center for Molecular Medicine at UCSD. 
Outside the lab I enjoy photography, chess, and dancing.
