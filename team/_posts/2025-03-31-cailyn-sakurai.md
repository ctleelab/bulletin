I am a Biological Sciences PhD student with a background in molecule biology and biochemistry. 
Previously, I worked at the University of California, Berkeley, in Krishna Niyogiâ€™s lab, where I studied photosystem assembly in thylakoid membranes. 
This project spurred my interest in the requirements for proper integration of large protein complexes into membranes. 
In the ctleelab, I hope to understand the physical forces between lipids and proteins and how these dynamic interactions dictate proper membrane protein assembly and disassembly.
