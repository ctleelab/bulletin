I am an undergraduate student studying Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry at Universidad Autónoma de Baja California. 
Previously I worked with PyRx, a Computational Drug Discovery program, for Molecular Docking as part of a summer investigation course.
I joined the ctleelab as a summer research intern through the [ENLACE](https://resilientmaterials.ucsd.edu/ENLACE) program. 
I will be studying actin-based motility on cells and hopefully, with the help of a computerized simulation, understanding how actin filaments and their different binding-proteins make cell migration possible.
In the long run, I would like to pursue Molecular Biology Research and hopefully contribute to innovating Drug Discovery.
