I am a Biological Science PhD student with a background in clinical and experimental neuroscience.
I received a medical degree from the University of Guadalajara, Mexico.
I joined the ctleelab for my third rotation with the aim of developing quantitative skills and expertise in computational approaches such as molecular dynamics simulations.
I am excited to investigate the biophysical properties of lipids in mitochondria and explore how lipid curvature impacts cellular function.
