I am a high school student at The Bishop's School, La Jolla. I am interested in mathematics, biology, and robotics. Previously, my robotics team won 1st place SuperTeam at the 2024 RoboCup International OnStage League in the Netherlands, where I collaborated with teams from Thailand and Taiwan. I have also researched the effects of toxins in the Tijuana River Estuary on medaka embryo development. Outside of school, I like swimming, photography, and video games.
