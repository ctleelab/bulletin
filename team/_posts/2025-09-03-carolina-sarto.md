Carolina hails from Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she earned her Ph.D. in Chemistry, supervised by Dr. Arrar 
at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA). Her doctoral research focused on the computational modeling of protein–RNA 
complexes critical for Dengue virus replication. Her current research will focus on developing models to investigate how membrane 
lipid composition influences lipid-protein dynamics in mitochondrial fission.
