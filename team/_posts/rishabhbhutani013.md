I am a current senior at Rocklin High School broadly interested in mathematics and physics. I have engaged in advanced coursework in areas such as Real and Complex Mathematical Analysis, Abstract Algebra, and Modern Physics through Sacramento State University and Stanford University. I am excited to contribute my knowledge to the lab! Please feel free to contact me for any inquires.
