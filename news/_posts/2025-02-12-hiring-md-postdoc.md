A position for a [Postdoctoral Scholar](#postdoctoral-scholar) is available immediately in the ctleelab at the University of California San Diego. 
Details for the position follow.


### Postdoctoral Scholar

The [ctleelab](https://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/ctlee/) is recruiting a postdoc in the fields of computational biophysics and molecular modeling.
Successful candidates will have a strong interest in applying molecular simulations to study how membrane organization influences organelle shape.

The goal of the lab is to develop and employ new computational tools, approaches, and strategies to integrate experimental data into biophysical simulations.
Using these simulations we aim to generate mechanistic insight into how organization-structure-function relationships at the subcellular scale governs membrane ultrastructure generating processes.


#### Responsibilities

This role advances the research aims of the ctleelab through a combination of project work and collaborations within the group and our collaborators. 
The postdoctoral scholar is expected to develop fellowship and other independent projects with the lab's support. 

- Development of molecular models and simulation datasets
- Prototyping of analysis workflows to support multiscale modeling efforts
- Supervision and training of other researchers in molecular simulations and scientific computing
- Development of scientific products including scripts and softwares
- Preparation of manuscripts, fellowship and grant applications in collaboration with the PI
- Attend and present research at group, local and national meetings

#### Qualifications
##### Minimum Qualifications

- PhD in computational biophysics, computer science, physics or related field
- Fluency in at least one high-level programming language (e.g., Python)
- Expertise in molecular dynamics simulations 
- Knowledge of statistical mechanics, membrane biology and structural biology
- Proficiency with high performance computing
- Motivated to learn new skills and technologies and collaborate within an existing team's practices
- Excellent written and verbal communication skills

##### Preferred Qualifications
- Applicants with prior exposure to free-energy calculations and continuum membrane mechanics are particularly encouraged to apply
- Familiarity with version control and other software development best practices
- Experience configuring and deploying analyses in a high-throughput manner


#### Application Requirements

The position is available immediately with flexible starting dates. 
Informal inquiries are welcome. 
Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.
The ctleelab works on interdisciplinary topics and recognizes that complementary backgrounds facilitate our science and goals.
As such, applicants with unique and complementary expertise to our ongoing team are particularly encouraged to apply.


Please contact Chris by email (ctlee<span style="display:none">obfuscate</span>@ucsd.edu) with the following.
1. cover letter that includes the names and contacts for two references and a short statement of research interests and envisioned interactions with the lab 
2. a current CV
3. code samples or links to published/distributed code 

To aid in applicant review, a coding sample is requested. 
We are happy to review whatever you are most proud of (in any programming language). 
If you do not have code that can be publicly shared, that is okay. 
Please apply anyway and just let us know that this is not available.
